# COMP475_A1_VR
This is a project for my Immersive Technology course, COMP 475. I built a barebones VR project for the Occulus Quest 2 in Unity using the XR interaction toolkit. It allows the player to grab objects and throw them around with physics. 

This project helped me understand the fundumentals of XR interaction and building projects to run on actual VR HMDs. I can easily build on top of it to create more environments and objects for the user to interact with.
